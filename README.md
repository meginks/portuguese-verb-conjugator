# portuguese-verb-conjugator
a declarative, lightweight verb conjugation engine for Portuguese in Python


I'm starting this by following the same pattern used for the [Spanish Verb Conjugator](https://github.com/meginks/spanish-verb-conjugator), at least in terms of the actual verb data because that reduced verb system, which I borrowed from Spanish Irregular Verbs Up Close of the McGraw Hill series Practice Makes Perfect by Dr. Eric Vogt, was based on Latin. I'm assuming that it will work for Portuguese, with some adjustments. For example, most verbs in Portuguese have more than one past participle, one of which is totally irregular. As a result, we need to keep track of both. 

I obviously don't own the Portuguese language, and I did not come up with these rules of conjugation, but I did write all the Python.
